Hi there!

I’ve seen a lot of request in the forum for Licenseplate streaming.
A lot of people are using the veshare.ydt in a stream folder, but this doesn’t work…

I made a Script where you can simply “stream” custom Licenseplates into your Server.
Normaly there are California plates.

Installation:
Simply put the “californiaplates” folder in your resources and start the script in the Server.cfg! “start californiaplates”
